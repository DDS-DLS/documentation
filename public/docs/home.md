# UICore Documentation

## Components

The components in our library are described first with how to initialize each one by HTML and then by javascript.  Wherever possible, we list all options, events, and methods given. Finally, live samples of varying types are available at the end of each page.

If a parameter is listed it will be *in italics*, while the values of the parameters are **in bold** font. When possible wherever a property is being described, the description will start with its property type in an inline `code block`.

All pages are listed in the [wiki contents page list](../pages).

## Models

Please take note of the documentation about the upcoming [Contributor Model](/Contributor-Model.md).
